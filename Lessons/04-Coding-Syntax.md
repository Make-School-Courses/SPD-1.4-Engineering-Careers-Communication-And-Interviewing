## Activity: Fix the Coding and Syntax Errors and Conventions (25 minutes)

### Part 1: FizzBuzz in JavaScript

Review this code snippet and find what’s wrong with it. What coding syntax errors does it have? Which conventions does it violate? How would you fix these?

Compare your results with 2-3 others and write down anything they caught but you had missed.
