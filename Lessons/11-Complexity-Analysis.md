## Activity 1: Worksheet

Make a copy of [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I6tFnjc_dLk70--JMG-eyyRPm2nXNtwWSCAEUBKbic0/edit). Analyze each of the problems on the worksheet and provide the Big O for runtime and space complexity.

## Activity 2: Rapid-Fire Breakouts

1. Find a partner and choose one of the below problems. You will go through the problem as if you were in an actual interview. 1. Your partner will  play the interviewer, and will have a checklist to make sure youâ€™re following the proper steps
Swap roles and do the other problem

**Pay attention to time/space complexity.** Write notes on the back of the checklist for improvements in this particular area.

Practice Problems:

1. Given a number k and a list of numbers, find the k largest elements in the list and return them in sorted order.
1. Given a number k and a list of numbers, find the kth most common element.
1. Given a sorted array, find the index of the first and last occurrence of a given element. If the given element is not found in the array, report that.
1. Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array.

## Homework

- Find 2 new problems on [Exercism](https://exercism.io) or [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and solve them following the problem solving strategy covered in a prior class to guide your thinking.
- Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution code and annotate this in comments.
- Commit your solution code and annotations to GitHub repo and submit using Gradescope.
