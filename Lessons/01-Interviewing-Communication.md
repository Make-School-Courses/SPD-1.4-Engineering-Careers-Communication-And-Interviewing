## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, you will be able to describe and practice each of the communication-focused steps of the technical interviewing process:

- Restate the problem
- Ask clarifying questions
- State your assumptions
- Think out loud
  - Brainstorm solutions
  - Explain your rationale
  - Discuss tradeoffs
  - Suggest improvements

## Warm-Up

With a partner, recall *one* technical interview you have done in the past (at Make School or elsewhere).

- What was hard about it?
- How could you have done better?


## Activity: Practice Interview Communication

Interview Problem: *Write a function that takes two lists named a and b, and returns a list of common values that are in both lists.*

### Part 1: Restate the Problem

1. Write down your restatement of the problem
1. With a partner, share your statement with them
1. Compare and contrast your statements to ensure you both fully understand the problem
1. Give each other feedback on problem statements

### Part 2: Ask Clarifying Questions

1. On your own, list 3+ clarifying questions to ask the interviewer.
1. Once you’re done, compare with a partner, and refine your questions based on their feedback.

### Part 3: State your Assumptions

1. Write down your own assumptions
1. Share your assumptions with a partner, and refine based on their feedback.

### Part 4: Think out Loud

1. Solve the problem aloud to a partner. As you work through your solution, make sure you hit all of these steps:
  1. Brainstorm solutions
  1. Explain your rationale
  1. Discuss tradeoffs
  1. Suggest improvements
1. Let your partner present to you, and listen to their solution
1. Discuss what you liked about each other’s approach, and what could be improved

### Communication Role Play

Breakout into pairs. One person is interviewer, the other is interviewee. Use the same practice question and interview each other.

### Practice Problem

Problem: *Given an array of n numbers that are all unique except for one duplicate, find the duplicate number.*
