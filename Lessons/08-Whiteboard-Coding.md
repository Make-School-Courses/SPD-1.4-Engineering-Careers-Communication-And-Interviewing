## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this class,  you should be able to...

1. Recognize the importance of manually testing your code before running it with an interpreter.
1. Use a variable table to keep track of program state at any given point in your program.

## Activity: Code Tracing

1. Choose a problem from the Repl.It project. Each solution contains at least one bug that you will be tasked with fixing.
1. Read over the problem statement and the code.
1. Create a “good/normal” input for the function.
1. Use a variable table to trace through the code to find the error.
1. Use Python Tutor to check your work.
1. If you spot the error right away, still go through the steps of the variable table!
1. Submit your solution when finished.

## Homework

1. Find 2 new problems on Leetcode.io and solve them following the problem solving strategy covered in a prior class to guide your thinking.
1. After you’ve written the code, use a variable table to trace through the code. Check your work using PythonTutor.
1. Commit your solution code and test cases to a GitHub repo and submit via Gradescope.
