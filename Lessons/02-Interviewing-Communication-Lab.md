## Worksheet (20 minutes)

Complete [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NFUlOR9v-j23Z6IM80z8Ev5iogDCWf7OgfIkmP09NU/edit#) on your own, then review your responses in a small group.

*Alternative Interview Question: Given an array of all duplicates except 1 unique value, find the unique value.*

## Break (10 minutes)

## Rapid-fire Breakouts (40 minutes)

**Instructions:**

1. Find a partner to do mock interviews with. One will play interviewer, one interviewee.
1. Work through the problem as if you’re in an actual interview. Your interviewer will have a checklist to make sure you follow the best-practice communication steps.
1. Give feedback on what they did/didn’t do.
1. Swap roles and work through problem 2.
1. Find a different partner and repeat the above steps (2-4) for problems 3 and 4.

**Practice Problems:**

1. Given two arrays, determine if both arrays contain exactly the same elements, regardless of their order.
1. Given a string containing a long text, find the most commonly occurring word in the text as well as its count.
1. Given a sorted array, find the index of the first and last occurrence of a given element. If the given element is not found in the array, report that.
1. Given an array a of numbers and a target value t, find two numbers that sum to `t` (that is, `a[i] + a[j] = t`).


## Homework

1. **Find 2 new problems on LeetCode** and follow the communication steps covered in last class to guide your thinking and problem solving.
1. **Write down and commit** your **communication steps** (in code comments) and **solution code** to a GitHub repository.
1. **Submit** your GitHub repository to Gradescope.
