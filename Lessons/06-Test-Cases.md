## Warm-Up #1: Problem Solving Strategy

Explain the **purpose** and **value** of each step of the problem solving strategy presented in last week's lesson:

1. Generate reasonable test inputs
1. Solve the problem by hand
  - Simplify the problem if needed
1. Find a pattern in your solution
1. Make a plan – Write pseudocode
1. Follow your plan – Write real code
1. Check your work – Test your code

Write in your notebook, then share with 1 or 2 partners.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this class,  you should be able to...

1. Define what good/normal, bad/unusual, and edge case inputs mean for test cases in relation to technical interview problems
1. Generate examples of each of these test cases during a technical interview in order to check how well your solution handles input

## Warm-Up #2: Types of Test Cases

In your own words, write down definitions for the following types of test cases:

1. Good/Normal Input
1. Bad/Unusual Input
1. Edge Case Input

Write in your notebook, then share with 1 or 2 partners.

## Activity: Inputs

Come up with 3 of each: Good/normal inputs, bad/unusual inputs, and edge case inputs.

Practice Problems:

1. Find the k largest values in an array of n numbers. Return them in a new array sorted in decreasing order.
1. Given an array a of numbers and a target value t, find two numbers that sum to t (that is, a[i] + a[j] = t).
1. Given a list of n strings with mixed casing, return a new list of all strings that start with a capitalized letter.
1. Find the longest substring of unique letters in a given string of n letters.

## Break

## Interview Breakouts

Each partner picks a problem to solve. Write pseudocode and then real code. Then, step through your code with one or two of each type of input test case:

1. Good/Normal Input
1. Bad/Unusual Input
1. Edge Case Input

Practice Problems:

1. Find the k largest values in an array of n numbers. Return them in a new array sorted in decreasing order.
1. Given an array a of numbers and a target value t, find two numbers that sum to t (that is, a[i] + a[j] = t).
1. Given a list of n strings with mixed casing, return a new list of all strings that start with a capitalized letter.
1. Find the longest substring of unique letters in a given string of n letters.

## Homework

- Find 2 new problems on Exercism.io and solve them following the problem solving strategy covered in last class to guide your thinking.
- Run your solution code on at least 2 inputs for each type of test case covered in this class.
- Commit your solution code and test cases to a GitHub repo and submit via Gradescope.
