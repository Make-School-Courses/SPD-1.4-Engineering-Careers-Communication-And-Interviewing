3. To stop the recording, click on the "Stop" icon on the right-hand side of the bar at the top of your screen.
4. Make sure to save your recording once you're satisfied with it.

## Tips

1. If you are recording yourself doing an interview question, I find it easier to use a web-based coding editor such as [Repl.it](https://repl.it) so that everything stays in one window and it's super easy to compile and run (and share your solution with others!).
