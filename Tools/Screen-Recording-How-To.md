# How to Make a Screen Recording (for Mac)

## Instructions

1. Go to your Application Launchpad and open the QuickTime Player application. The bar at the top of your screen should show `QuickTime Player`.
1. Click on `File -> New Screen Recording`, click the Record button, then click on the window you want to record, or drag the mouse to choose an area to record.
1. To stop the recording, click on the "Stop" icon on the right-hand side of the bar at the top of your screen.
1. Make sure to save your recording once you're satisfied with it.

## Tips

1. If you are recording yourself doing an interview question, I find it easier to use a web-based coding editor such as [Repl.it](https://repl.it) so that everything stays in one window and it's super easy to compile and run (and share your solution with others!).
