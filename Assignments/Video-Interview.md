# Video Interview Assignment

## Overview

For this assignment, you will create a screencast video [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdCeU8DJvPM) of yourself solving a technical interview problem of your choice.

## Why should I do this?

_"Practice doesn't make perfect. Practice makes permanent."_ 

In a real high-pressure situation, you won't be able to calmly list out all of the steps and follow them - you will fall back on what you have practiced and made into habit. And the only way to develop good habits is to practice and get feedback!

Completing mock interviews in class with a partner is one thing, but the only way to _really_ evaluate your own performance is to watch yourself on video. You will notice things that you never would have noticed otherwise! It is a great way to level up your skills in addition to receiving feedback from others.

## Requirements

First, you'll need to choose a technical interview problem to solve. This may be one that you already know the answer to! In fact, that may be preferable, as you will be better able to focus on practicing the steps.

If you are looking for a problem to use, [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/10-algorithms-to-solve-before-your-python-coding-interview-feb74fb9bc27) is a good list of beginner-level problems. Alternatively, you may use a problem from HackerRank or Leetcode which you have previously solved.

**In your video submission, you must complete the following:**

1. Restate the problem in your own words
1. Ask clarifying questions and/or state your assumptions about the inputs & outputs
1. Identify at least 3 test cases (inputs & their outputs), including any relevant edge cases
1. (Optional) Identify the "brute force" solution, if one exists
1. Solve the problem & discuss the solution (E.g. draw a picture, make an analogy, brainstorm a data structure/algorithm to use, compare/contrast with similar/different problems, list out relevant tools you have and pick the right one, break down the problem into smaller problems and solve those first)
1. Pick a solution (consider tradeoffs)
1. Psuedocode your solution
1. Code your solution
1. Walk through test inputs with your coded solution
1. Review your solution: state what you see as good and bad about your solution. How could you have made it better or faster?
